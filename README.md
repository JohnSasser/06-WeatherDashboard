# 06-WeatherDashboard

It's a Weather App.

# Description

This work is a simple weather tracker and forecast app, build with the [open weather api](https://openweathermap.org/). Search for your city or, as the background image indicates, anywhere on earth! The top-right box houses the current weather in the location, and the bottom-right box will show a 5 day forecast for the given location.

Enjoy and remember,
Efficiency is the key to success!!!

# About

I built this with a very basic understanding of local storage, JSON, API's and JavaScript in general. I would like to come back and further build-out the app to offer "current location" services. The app will populate your current location's weather, once the request is approved.

# Usage

The "current weather" & "forecast" functions live inside one-another. I will get better at using call-backs and build this in a more efficient manor in the future. Constructive criticism is invited and welcome.
